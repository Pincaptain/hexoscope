# Hexoscope

## Description

Hexoscope is a JavaScript application that enables users to create custom maps for the Hexoscope game and play them.

Using the map creator interface provided by this application, users can design intricate game maps by placing hexagonal
chips with various configurations on a grid. Each chip represents a puzzle piece with different pin arrangements. The
challenge is to swap chips with each other strategically to combine their pins and create a solid chain from the power
source to the power receiver. For more information about the game, visit this

Once the map is created, users can easily start the game with a single button press and immerse themselves in playing on
the map they have meticulously designed.
